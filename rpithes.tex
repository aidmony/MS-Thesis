%1. The motivation of an extended balance theory with relations of strengths.
%2. Address the balance tendency assumption. 
%The possible applications of balance tendency (convergence), and the unsolved problems. 
%3. Propose signed edge prediction as an application of social network convergence.
%4. Outline the structure of the thesis

\include{rpichap1}  

%1. Review of Cartwright-Harary's structural balance theory.
% Weak and Strong, global and local.
%2. Review on social network balance tendency(convergence)
%3. Review on signed edge prediction problems
\include{rpichap2}
% Charpter on Extended Balance Theory
% 1. Consider the general case when relations have varying strengths.
%     Review the arguments of balance/imbalance of a triad in terms of stress/tension
%     Refine the arguments by the concept of tolerance, as well as two principles regarding it.
%     Argue balance at a finer level is a matter of tolerance satisfaction.

% 2. Discuss the measurement of relations with strengths
% 2.1 Relations have signs and relative strengths, and hence inherit a total ordering. 
%        Tolarence is defined in terms of <>
% 	     Show Cartwright-harary's balance as an example of binary measurement. 
%        Give table of tolerance rules and justify it w.r.t. two principles
%        Show the balance theory corresponding to a five-category measurement of relations
%		Give table of tolerance rules and justify it w.r.t. two principles

% 2.2  Assume relations are well measured numerically. 
% 		Propose a general tolerance rule, and corresponding balance definition 
%		Show Cartwright-harary's balance and five-category are special cases under the general rule
% 		The definition of a balanced social network. Alternatively, a network is balanced if it can be drawn in space

% Charpter on Convergence Model
% 1. Motivations not restricted to a pure theoretical aspect, as it provides predictive attributes.
%     1.1 List some of the famous predictive phenomenon
% 2. Describe the intuition, and formulate the model in terms of a MDS problem
%      2.1 Proofs/illustrations of phenomenons in 1.1
